## Overview

  This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### Built with

Basic HTML and CSS

### What I learned

I try to force myself to think thorough the project and make some kind of plan first, instead of just jumping into it headlong. I can also practice the BEM naming convention and the use of GitHub with this project.

### Useful resources
